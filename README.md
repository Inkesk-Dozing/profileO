## üéØ Objectives & Assignment Coverage

### Assignment-1: Semantic HTML5 Portfolio
- **Use only semantic HTML5 tags:** `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, `<table>`, `<form>`, `<button>`, etc.
- **Navigation bar** with links for smooth section jumps.
- **Structured content:** Includes hero section, about with profile image, projects list, skills table, and contact form.
- **Accessibility:** Alt text for images, semantic labels for forms.
- **Validation:** Form fields use `required` attributes.
- **No external CSS:** Styles are not applied; HTML structure focuses on semantics.

### Assignment-2: HTML5 with External CSS
- **Separation of style and structure:** All styles are in an external CSS (`style.css`), no inline CSS.
- **Navigation bar** with background, links, hover/focus, and padding.
- **Consistent color theme:** Uses CSS variables for HEX/RGB colors.
- **Fixed and responsive sections:** Utilizes box model (margin, padding, border, border-radius, box-shadow) for spacing and layout.
- **Styled table for skills:** Alternating row colors using `:nth-child` selector, bold headers, cell padding.
- **Styled buttons:** Custom color, padding, border-radius, and interaction effects on hover/focus.
- **CSS positioning:** Example: fixed "Back to Top" button and relative positions for other UI elements.
- **Custom `<hr>` separators** for section clarity.
- **Accessibility:** Alt text for images, semantic labels for forms, and Google Fonts for legibility.
- **Validation:** All form fields use `required` attributes.
- **Mobile responsiveness:** Layout adjusts via responsive units and tested on multiple device widths.
- **Fallbacks:** Profile images have alt text for accessibility.

## üß† About This Project

These assignments demonstrate the progression from semantic HTML5 structure to styled, responsive web design. Assignment-1 focuses on semantic markup for accessibility and structure, while Assignment-2 adds external CSS for visual design and interactivity.

The websites are structured around the following core ideas:
- **Clarity:** Each section‚Äîwelcome, about, projects, skills, contact‚Äîhas a clear role.
- **Semantics:** HTML tag choice reflects the meaning and role of content, improving accessibility and SEO.
- **Separation:** In Assignment-2, all CSS is kept in a separate file for maintainability and assignment compliance.
- **Progressive enhancement:** Future JavaScript features could be added for interactivity.

## üß© Site Structure

### Assignment-1 Structure
- **Header & Navigation**: `<header>` with name and `<nav>` with links to sections.
- **Main Content (`<main>`)**: Includes hero section, about with profile image, projects list, skills table, and contact form.
- **Contact Form**: Outside `<main>`, with labels, inputs, and buttons.
- **Footer**: Copyright notice.

### Assignment-2 Structure
- **Header & Navigation**: `<header>` with title and inline `<nav>` links.
- **Main Content (`<main>`)**: Sections for about (with image), skills table, projects (divs), and contact form (table-based).
- **Back to Top Button**: Fixed positioned link.
- **Footer**: Copyright notice.

Both assignments use semantic HTML5 for structure and accessibility.
