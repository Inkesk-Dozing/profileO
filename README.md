# 🌐 Harsh Dev Jha — Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project is a creative and technical showcase of who I am, what I build, and how I think. It’s designed to be clean, responsive, and expressive—just like the tools I love to create.

## 🧠 About This Project

This site is built entirely with HTML and styled through external CSS. It features:

- A fixed header and navigation bar for smooth browsing
- A search bar for exploring site fragments
- A responsive layout with semantic structure
- Fallback image handling for graceful degradation
- A contact form and social media links for easy connection

Whether you're a fellow developer, recruiter, or curious visitor—this portfolio is meant to be both informative and welcoming.
